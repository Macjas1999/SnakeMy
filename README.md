# SnakeMy
Game of snake in **c++**

* GUI library is wxWidgets.
* I have drawn snake segments and apples myself.


Building the game requires wxWidgets library insatalled. Compiling the game should be done from the “SnakeMy” directory, for example using:<br>
**`g++ source/snakeMy.cpp \\` wx-config --cxxflags --libs std \\` -o exe/snakeMy.exe**<br>
If wxWidgests have been installed properly, this should result in “snakeMy.exe” being created in the  “exe” directory. You need to give this file rights to execute as a program, and now, you can enjoy this interpretation of well known snake game.
